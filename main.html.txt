Program Statement: 
3. a. Read N numbers from the console and create a list. Develop a program to print mean, 
variance and standard deviation with suitable messages
Program Code:
import statistics
a = list() #empty list
number = int(input("Enter the number of elements you want: ")) #ask user to enter the values
print ('Enter number in array: ')
for i in range(int(number)):
 n = input("number : ")
 a.append (int( n )) # append method will odd elements in list
print("\n Given 'n' number: ")
print(a)
m = statistics.mean ( a )
v = statistics.variance( a )
st = statistics.stdev( a )
print( "\n Mean: ",m)
print( "\n Variance: ",v)
print( "\n Standard Deviation: ",st)


Program Statement: 
3. b. Read a multi-digit number (as chars) from the console. Develop a program to print the 
frequency of each digit with a suitable message.
Program Code:
a=input("enter a multi digit number:") # reading each digit as character
l=list(a) # converting string to list
print("\n list of given number is l=",l)
freq=[l.count(ele) for ele in l]
d=dict(zip(l, freq))
print("\n frequency of each digit is:",d)
